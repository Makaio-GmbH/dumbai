# Example: Multi-Level Research Short-Circuiting

## Scenario: "Add Real-Time Collaboration to Document Editor"

This example shows how research at different levels can dramatically reduce or eliminate development work.

---

## Path A: Without Multi-Level Research (Build Everything)

### Missions Created (15 total)
1. design-crdt-architecture
2. implement-operational-transform
3. build-websocket-server
4. create-conflict-resolution
5. implement-cursor-tracking
6. build-presence-system
7. create-undo-redo-stack
8. implement-offline-sync
9. build-reconnection-logic
10. create-permission-system
11. implement-version-history
12. build-collaborative-cursors
13. create-comment-threads
14. implement-change-tracking
15. build-awareness-protocol

### Time Estimate: 3-4 weeks
### Maintenance: High (custom CRDT implementation)
### Risk: Very High (distributed systems are hard)

---

## Path B: With Multi-Level Research (Actual Result)

### Level 1: Strategic Research (Planner)

**Research Performed**:
```typescript
const platforms = [
  'Liveblocks',     // Complete collaboration platform
  'Yjs',            // CRDT framework
  'ShareJS',        // OT framework
  'Firepad',        // Firebase-based editor
  'Pusher',         // Real-time infrastructure
];
```

**Finding**: Liveblocks provides complete solution!

**Decision**: USE PLATFORM

### Result: Single Mission Created
```yaml
---
mission: integrate-liveblocks
status: planned
blocked_by: []
---

# Mission: integrate-liveblocks

## Tasks
- [ ] Sign up for Liveblocks account
- [ ] Install @liveblocks/client and @liveblocks/react
- [ ] Configure authentication endpoint
- [ ] Add LiveblocksProvider to app
- [ ] Implement useOthers() for presence
- [ ] Add useStorage() for document state
```

### Time: 2 days
### Maintenance: Low (managed service)
### Risk: Low (battle-tested platform)

---

## Alternative Path C: Tactical Research Finds Framework

If Liveblocks was too expensive, Tactical Research would find:

### Level 2: Tactical Research (Supervisor)

**Research**: Yjs provides CRDT framework

**Missions Created** (reduced from 15 to 3):
1. integrate-yjs-core
2. setup-y-websocket
3. implement-yjs-providers

### Time: 1 week (vs 3-4 weeks)

---

## Alternative Path D: Implementation Research Finds Packages

Even if building custom, Implementation Research finds:

### Level 3: Implementation Research (Specialist)

For each task:
- WebSocket handling → use `ws` package
- CRDT implementation → use `automerge`
- Reconnection → use `reconnecting-websocket`
- Presence → use `perfect-cursors`

### Impact: Each finding saves 2-3 days of work

---

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

| Approach | Development Time | Monthly Cost | Maintenance | Risk |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|------|
| Build Everything | 3-4 weeks | $0 | Very High | Very High |
| Use Yjs Framework | 1 week | $0 | Medium | Medium |
| Use Liveblocks | 2 days | $79/mo | Very Low | Very Low |

**Clear Winner**: Liveblocks (unless very cost-sensitive)

---

## The 99/1 Rule in Action

This example perfectly demonstrates why research at multiple levels is critical:

1. **99% of "build" requests** have existing solutions
2. **Strategic Research** found complete platform (Liveblocks)
3. **Result**: 2 days vs 3-4 weeks (93% time saved)
4. **Bonus**: Better quality, less maintenance, proven scale

## Key Lesson

**Without Research**: 15 complex missions, distributed systems nightmare
**With Research**: 1 simple integration mission, done in 2 days

This is why you were RIGHT to challenge the framework. Research isn't optional - it's the MOST IMPORTANT part of modern development. Building should be the LAST resort, not the first instinct.

## Research Decision Tree

```
User Request
    ↓
Strategic Research: "Is there a platform/SaaS?"
    YES → Use it (2 days)
    NO ↓
Tactical Research: "Is there a framework?"
    YES → Use it (1 week)
    NO ↓
Implementation Research: "Are there packages?"
    YES → Use them (2 weeks)
    NO ↓
Build Custom (3-4 weeks) ← LAST RESORT!
```

## Framework Update Needed

The DUMBAI framework should be renamed to:
**Research-First Deterministic Development (RFDD)**

Because the research IS the development. The building is just integration.
